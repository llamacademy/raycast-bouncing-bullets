# Bouncing Bullets with Hitscan Guns 

Learn how to use Vector3.Reflect to upgrade your Raycast/Hitscan bullets so they can ricochet or bounce off any objects!

The [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/GkStW8-Q5P0) takes you from no code at all to a fully functioning raycast hitscan gun (no randomness added, you can learn about that [here](https://youtu.be/cI3E7_f74MA)) that can optionally enable bouncing bullets that will bounce based on a maximum bounce distance.
This tutorial specifically does not use object pooling to keep the tutorial simple and easy to follow. If you don't know what Object Pooling is you can use [this video for Unity 2020 and lower](https://youtu.be/fsDE_mO4RZM), or [this one for Unity 2021+](https://youtu.be/zyzqA_CPz2E).
